This assembly program decodes/ecodes a series of strings using different encrypting/decrypting methods.
The decrypting methods implemented are:
	- XOR on two strings of bytes
	- rolling XOR on a string of bytes
	- XOR between two strings represented by hexadecimal characters
	- Decrypting a string in a base32 representation.
	- Bruteforce XOR with a 1 byte key. (clue: decrypted string contains "force" string)
	- Vigenere Cipher
